        <h2 style="color:red;"> Introduction</h2>
             <p class="b">The 2020 Indian Premier League, also known as IPL 13 is the thirteenth season of the IPL,
                a professional Twenty20 cricket (T20) league established by the Board of Control for
                 Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007.
                 <br>
               The tournament was originally scheduled to commence on 29 March 2020, but was suspended until
               15 April due to the global coronavirus pandemic. After Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced
               on 14 April that the lockdown in India would last until at least 3 May 2020, the BCCI suspended the
               tournament indefinitely.
               <br> On 2 August 2020, it was announced that the tournament would be played between
                19 September and 10 November 2020 in the United Arab Emirates. On 10 August 2020, the Indian government
                gave its permission for the tournament to take place in the UAE. The full fixtures for the tournament
                 were confirmed on 6 September 2020.
                 <br>
                 On 4 August 2020, VIVO pulled out as the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League (IPL)
                 for this year's edition.
                  On 18 August, Fantasy cricket league platform Dream11 was named title sponsors rights with the
                   bid of â‚¹222 crore (US$31 million) crore for IPL 2020.
                    On 29 August, Indian online education technology company Unacademy was named official partner
                     of IPL until 2022.</p>
