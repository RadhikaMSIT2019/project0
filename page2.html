<p class="b">The BCCI released the fixture details on 18 February 2020. The league stage was scheduled to start on 29 March 2020, with the opening match between Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings, the finalists of the previous season, at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.[13] However, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray announced on 12 March that IPL matches can be held in the state only if they are played in empty stadiums.[14] Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia declared that no IPL matches will be held in Delhi.<br></p>

<p class="b">On 13 March, the BCCI suspended the tournament until 15 April, in view of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
The decision regarding the postponement was reached by the Governing Council after a meeting with the owners
of all eight franchise teams.On 9 April, with India under a nationwide lockdown,
a BCCI official told CNBC TV18 that the Board was considering hosting the tournament in July or during the
winter, possibly behind closed doors. On 14 April 2020, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the lockdown
in India would last until at least 3 May 2020, with the tournament postponed further.
 The following day, the BCCI suspended the tournament indefinitely due to the pandemic.<br>

On 17 April 2020, Sri Lanka Cricket offered to host the tournament. On 17 May 2020, the Indian government relaxed
nation-wide restrictions on sports events, allowing events to take place behind closed doors.
 On 24 May, Indian sports minister Kiren Rijiju stated that the decision on whether or not to allow the tournament
 to be conducted in 2020 will be made by the Indian government based on "the situation of the pandemic".
  News reports on 17 July suggested that the BCCI was considering hosting the tournament in the United Arab Emirates
  between the tentative dates of 26 September and 7 November.<br>

After the International Cricket Council (ICC) postponed the 2020 edition of the Men's T20 World Cup, the BCCI sought
Government of India's permission to move the tournament to the UAE. On 24 July 2020, IPL Governing Council
chairman Brijesh Patel said that the tournament would be played in the UAE between 19 September and 10 November,
 should it get the nod from Government of India. The official announcement is yet to be made by the BCCI.
  Patel added that the decision to allow spectators at the three venues–Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah–will be taken
   by the Government of the United Arab Emirates.</p>
